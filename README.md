# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python.
The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

How to Play
Run the tic_tac_toe.py script.
Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their mark (e.g., "1,1" for the top-left corner).
The game alternates between "X" and "O" marks.
The game announces the winner or declares a draw when the board is full.
Features
Simple console-based interface.
Two-player mode for local multiplayer.
Basic input validation to ensure valid moves.
